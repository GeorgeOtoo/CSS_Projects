                    <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>

                    <p id="para">Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reason. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>

                    <ul id="para_ul">
                        <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a><p>Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x;</span>
                        </p></li>

                        <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a><p>Assignement operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a vlue to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class="purple">var x = 10;</span></p>
                        </li>

                        <li><a href="#">Data Types</a><p>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables, you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are Jvascript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or <span class="purple">false;</span> null - <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purple">[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p>
                        </li>

                        <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a>
                            <p>
                                When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code bloacks based on values or coditions that have been met. You can use coditionals statements in your code to achieve this. There are the following coditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> a specified coditiona is true do this code in our code bloacks; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code; 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="#">Loops</a>
                            <p>
                                There are different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat some actions some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="#">Loops</a>

                                Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea. W e open up the instruction manual and get started. First we screw to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! W finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again. 
                            </p>
